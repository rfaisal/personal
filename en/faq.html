					<balise id="Q1"> </balise>
					<b>Q: Where do I get the money to pay for my expenses to go to the CUMC?</b> 
					<p> <b>A:</b> Start by contacting the mathematics students' society of your university. 
					They have possibly made arrangements for the students who want to attend the conference. If you are doing 
					summer research, talk to your supervisor. He or she may have grants for traveling, and may 
					help you out; in fact, he or she may want to help you out even without grants. </p>

					<p>Also try the mathematics department, or any department with which you are affiliated. 
					Tell them about the CUMC, show them our website, our  poster and explain your situation to them. 
					Let the department know that you are representing your university at the CUMC. 
					This is in fact how most delegates manage to attend the CUMC from year to year, 
					as most academic departments and faculties leave aside a specific portion of their 
					budgets for situations such as this one. Hint: Departments are more likely to sponsor you if you give a talk! </p>


					<balise id="Q2"> </balise>
					<b>Q: Will everybody be better at math than I am? </b> 
					<p> <b>A:</b> The CUMC caters to all undergraduate students who are interested in 
					mathematics and related disciplines. This conference is not a competition, 
					but rather a gathering of math enthusiasts from across Canada (and other countries too).
					We warmly welcome students of all abilities to attend, and we reiterate that there will be 
					no element of competition throughout the conference - well, except for bidding to host the 2013 CUMC. </p>

					<balise id="Q3"> </balise>
					<b>Q: I cannot attend the whole conference. Should I still go to parts of it? </b> 
					<p> <b>A:</b> Since we don't have a variable pricing scheme, you would still have 
					to pay the same registration cost for the conference (your accommodation would be 
					cheaper, of course). If you can make it to most days of the conference, we still 
					highly encourage you to attend, because with the list of speakers we have lined 
					up and the goodies we're offering (food, t-shirts, conference packages), it's still 
					a very good deal, not to mention that it's going to be a great experience. </p>

					<balise id="Q4"> </balise>
					<b>Q: How do I get to the University of British Columbia (Okanagan Campus)? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Please refer to the 
					<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=UBC+Okanagan,+University+Way,+Kelowna,+British+Columbia,+Canada&hl=en&sll=49.940331,-119.389524&sspn=0.006504,0.01929&t=h&z=14" target="_blank">map</a>. </p>

					<balise id="Q5"> </balise>
					<b>Q: Suppose that I want to give a talk; what should I talk about? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Talk about something that interests you. If you find it fascinating, 
					then chances are your audience will too. Of course, it should have a connection 
					to mathematics. Possible topics include, but are not limited to: 
						</p><ul>
						<li>something on which you have studied in class and really enjoyed; </li>
						<li>something that you have read about on your own time; </li>
						<li>something that you have done original research on. </li>
						</ul>
					If you think that your talk will be accessible only to students with a strong background 
					in a certain area of mathematics, then please make sure to put that in your abstract. <p></p>

					<balise id="Q6"> </balise>
					<b>Q: I find a certain subject interesting, but don't know much about it; can I give a talk on it? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Certainly! Use the preparation of your talk as an opportunity to learn more about the subject. 
					Make sure, however, to start preparing a while in advance, so that you have time to become confident with 
					the subject by the time you actually give your talk.  </p>

					<balise id="Q7"> </balise>
					<b>Q: What is the length of a talk </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> There are 2 options: 20 minutes or 45 minutes. </p>

					<balise id="Q8"> </balise>
					<b> Q: How do I decide on the length of my talk?</b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Try to evaluate the amount of material you would like to present. Do a test run and see how 
					long it takes you. Keep in mind that it is harder to keep the audience's attention for 45 minutes than it 
					is to do so for 20 minutes. On the other hand, if the subject is really interesting and you are well-prepared, 
					45 minutes will seem like a breeze. After all, your professors give long lectures, and at least some of 
					them - hopefully - do a good job! </p>

					<balise id="Q9"> </balise>
					<b> Q: In what language should I give my talk (i.e. English or French)? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> You should give the talk in the language that you feel more comfortable with. 
					You could try giving your talk in one language and preparing slides in another. 
					You may also want to mention to your audience that you welcome questions in either English or French. </p>

					<balise id="Q10"> </balise>
					<b> Q: I am really nervous; this is the first time I am giving a talk; how do I handle it? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Relax, take it easy! Even if you don't give a perfect talk, it's not the end of the world. 
					Add some humour to your presentation; make sure that your audience is with you at all times. If you run 
					out of time, don't speed up unnecessarily: cut your talk short instead. </p>

					<balise id="Q11"> </balise>
					<b> Q: There is a talk that I really want to go to that is happening at the same time as my own! </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> That's not really a question. However, if that happens, you can do several things: 
						</p><ul>
						<li>ask a friend to go to the other talk, take notes, and then give them to you afterwards, or  </li>
						<li> approach the speaker and ask him or her to provide you with some notes and/or some 
						  resources/references that would allow you to find out more about this interesting subject. </li>
						</ul>
					<p></p>

					<balise id="Q12"> </balise>
					<b> Q: There is a talk that looks interesting, but I don't have the prerequisites; what do I do? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Oftentimes, you can enjoy a presentation without fully understanding all the details. 
					If you are interested in the subject, then give it a try; at worst, it will give you an incentive 
					to acquire the necessary background, and you will still have learned something new. </p>

					<balise id="Q13"> </balise>
					<b> Q: What if I have a question that is not covered by this section? </b>
					<p><b>A:</b> Check out the other sections of our website. If you still can't find the answer, 
					then send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:cumc.2012@ubc.ca"> cumc.2012@ubc.ca </a>.</p>
