==

jq is a command-line JSON processor.

If you want to learn to use jq, read the documentation at

documentation is generated from the docs/ folder of this repository.

If you want to hack on jq, feel free, but be warned that its internals
are not well-documented at the moment. Bring a hard hat and a shovel.

You can find some basic build instructions at
